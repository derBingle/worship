VERSE 1

Years I spent in vanity and pride
Caring not my Lord was crucified
Knowing not it was for me he died 
On Calvary

CHORUS

Mercy there was great, and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me
There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary

VERSE 2

By God's Word at last my sin I learned
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned
'Till my guilty soul, imploring, turned
To Calvary

VERSE 3

Now I've given to Jesus everything
Now I gladly own him as my king
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary

VERSE 4

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary
