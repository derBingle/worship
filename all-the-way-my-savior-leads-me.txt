VERSE 1

All the way my Savior leads me
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt his tender mercy
Who through life has been my guide?
Heavenly peace, divinest comfort
Here by faith in Him to dwell
For I know whatever befall
Jesus doeth all things well

VERSE 2
All the way my Savior leads me
CHeers each winding path I tread
Gives me grace for every trial
Feeds me with the living bread
THough my weary steps may falter
And my soul athirst may be
Gushing from the Rock before me
Lo! A spring of joy I see

VERSE 3
All the way my Savior leads me
Oh, the fullness of His love
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's house above
When my spirit, clothed immortal
Wings its flight to realms of day
This my song through endless ages
Jesus led me all the way
