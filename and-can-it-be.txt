VERSE 1

And can it be that I should gain
And interest in the Savior's blood
Died he for me, who caused his pain?
For me, who him to death pursued?
Amazing love, how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

CHORUS

Amazing love, how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

VERSE 2

He left His Father's throne above
So free, so infinite His grace
Emptied Himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race
'Tis mercy all, immense and free
O praise my God, it reaches me

VERSE 3

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bout in sin and nature's night
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee

VERSE 4

No condemnation now I dread
Jesus and all in Him is mine!
Alive in him, my living Head
And clothed in righteousness divine
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ my own
