VERSE 1

He leadeth me, oh blessed thought
O words with heavenly comfort frought
Whate'er I do, wheree'er I be
Still tis God's hand that leadeth me

CHORUS

He leadeth me, he leadeth me,
By his own hand he leadeth me
His faithful follower I would be
For by his hand he leadeth me

VERSE 2

Sometimes mid scenes of deepest gloom
Sometimes whene Eden's bowers bloom
By waters still, o'er troubled sea
Still tis his hand that leadeth me

VERSE 3

Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine
Nor ever murmur nor repine
Content whatever lot I see
Since 'tis thy hand that leadeth me

VERSE 4

And when my task on earth is done
When, by thy grace, the victory's one
Even death's cold wave I will not flee
Since God through Jordan leadeth me
