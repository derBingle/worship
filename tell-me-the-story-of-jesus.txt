VERSE 1

Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard

Tell how the angels in chorus
Sang as they welcomed His birth
"Glory to God in the highest,
Peace and good tidings to earth!"

CHORUS

Tell me the story of Jesus
Write on my heart every word
Tell me the story most precious
Sweetest that ever was heard

VERSE 2

Fasting alone in the desert,
Tell of the days that are past
How for our sins he was tempted
Yet was triumphant at last
Tell of the years of his labor
Tell of the sorrow he bore
He was despised and afflicted
Homeless, rejected, and poor

VERSE 3

Tell of the cross where they nailed him
Suffering in anguish and pain
Tell of the grave where they laid him
Tell how he liveth again
Love in that story so tender
Clearer than ever I see
Stay, let me weep while you whisper
Love paid the ransom for me
