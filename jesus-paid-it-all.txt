VERSE 1

I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small
Child of weakness, watch and pray
Find in me thine all in all."

CHORUS

Jesus paid it all
All to him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain
He washed it white as snow

VERSE 2

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power, and thine alone
Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

VERSE 3

For nothing good have I
Whereby thy grace to claim
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb

VERSE 4

And when before the throne
I stand in him complete
"Jesus died my soul to save"
My lips shall still repeat
