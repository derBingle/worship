VERSE 1

Come, thou long-expected Jesus,
Born to set thy people free
From our fears and sins release us
Let us find our rest in thee

Israel's strength and consolation
Hope of all the earth thou art
Dear desire of every nation
Joy of every longing heart

VERSE 2

Born thy people to deliver
Born a child and yet a king
Born to reight in us forever
Now thy gracious Kingdom bring

By thine own eternal spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone
By thine all sufficient merit
Raise us to thy glorious throne
