VERSE 1

All creatures of our God and King
Lift up your voice and with us sing
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Thou burning sun with golden beam
Thou silver moon with softer gleam

CHORUS
O praise Him! O praise Him!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!

Thou rushing wind that art so strong
Ye clouds that sail in heaven along
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Thou rising morn, in praise rejoice
Ye light of evening, find a voice!

And all ye men of tender heart
Forgiving others take your part
O sing ye! Alleluia!
Ye who long pain and sorrow bear
Praise God and on Him cast your care

VERSE 4
Let all things their Creator bless
And worship Him in humbleness
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Praise, praise the Father, praise the Son
And praise the Spirit, Three in One!

VERSE 5
Praise God from whom all blessings flow
Praise Him all creatures here below
O praise Him! Alleluia!
Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
