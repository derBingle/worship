VERSE 1

Alas, and did my Savior bleed,
And did my Sovereign die
Would he devote that sacred head
For sinners such as I?

CHORUS 

At the cross, at the cross,
Where I first saw the light
And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith I received my sight
And now I am happy all the day

VERSE 2

Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown
And love beyond degree

VERSE 3

Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut his glories in
When Christ the mighty maker died
for man, the creature's sin

VERSE 4

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While Calvary's cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt mine eyes to tears

VERSE 5

But drops of grief can ne'r repay
The debt of love I owe
Here Lord, I give myself away
'Tis all that I can do
