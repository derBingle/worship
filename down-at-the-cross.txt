VERSE 1

Down at the cross where my Savior died
Down where from cleansing from sin I cried
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to his name!

CHORUS

Glory to his name! Glory to his name!
There to my heart was the blood applied
Glory to his name!

VERSE 2

I am so wondrously saved from sin
Jesus so sweetly abides within
There at the cross where he took me in
Glory to his name!

VERSE 3

Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin
I am so glad I have entered in
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean
Glory to his name!

VERSE 4

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet
Cast thy poor soul at the savior's feet
Plunge in today and be made complete
Glory to his name!
